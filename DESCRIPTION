Description: Measurement error is a common issue in many statistical applications, especially when the error pattern is informative. This package deals with the setting of imperfectly observed binary data and the estimation of average treatment effects (ATE) under imperfectly observed confounding. In particular, we assume that binary confounders may be underreported, with the data containing a biased proxy of the true confounder values. In a sensitivity-type analysis we answer the question: which rate of (informative) measurement error would be needed to change the sign of causal effect estimate? The interpretable sensitivity parameter is the data fidelity -- the probability that a confounder is recorded correctly.
